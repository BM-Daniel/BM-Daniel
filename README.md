### Hi World ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a learner in programming languages from Ghana


**BM-Daniel/BM-Daniel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on simple projects involving Web development, C programming and MATLAB and hope to do more after my learning

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C Programming and Web development in depth
